## Planning

### First Phase (Doa Database)

1. Gather data until we have 50 doa

1. OAuth
2. Create custom order of Doa for Doa after prayer
3. Download Doa image
4. Share Doa with link or QR
5. Endpoint to collab with SedekahJe

### Third Phase (Sub Functions #1)

1. Browse Doa
2. Bookmark
3. One minute tutorial guidance

### Fourth Phase (Sub Functions #2)

1. Write specific Doa in Bahasa Melayu or English
2. AI to verify user written Doa

### Fifth Phase (Sub Functions #3)

1. Browse Doa based on situation or problem

## Ideas from others

1. Doa collector: Umrah or Haji usecase where people usually request to Doa for them
